### I/O Redirection
Redirection can be defined as changing the way from where commands read input or send output. 

Bash shell has three basic streams:

1. Takes input from stdin (stream 0)

2. Sends output to stdout (stream 1)

3. Sends error messages to stderr (stream 2)

### Program environment
The context in which code is being executed. It is any software application installed in your computer. 

This includes (but not limited to):

1. IDEs
2. Compilers/Interpreters
3. OS

### Background execution
Background execution is just letting the app code run in the background while it is not in the foreground. This means that the user is currently not using the software.
